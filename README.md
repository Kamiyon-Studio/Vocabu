**Final Project – System Integration and Architecture**

## Project Description
The VOCABU Educational Game is a mobile/desktop application designed to help users build vocabulary through interactive gameplay. The core function involves completing words from a definition, categorizing the words by their part of speech (Noun, Verb, Adjective), and tracking progress via an in-game dictionary/Worddex.
